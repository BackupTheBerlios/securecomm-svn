 * IST-FP6-034763 QualiPSo: QualiPSo is a unique alliance 
 * of European, Brazilian and Chinese ICT industry players, 
 * SMEs, governments and academics to help industries and 
 * governments fuel innovation and competitiveness with Open 
 * Source software. To meet that goal, the QualiPSo consortium 
 * intends to define and implement the technologies, processes 
 * and policies to facilitate the development and use of Open 
 * Source software components, with the same level of trust 
 * traditionally offered by proprietary software. QualiPSo is 
 * partially funded by the European Commission under EUï¿½s sixth 
 * framework program (FP6), as part of the Information Society 
 * Technologies (IST) initiative. 
 * 
 * This program has been created as part of the QualiPSo work 
 * package on "Semantic Interoperability". The basic idea is to show 
 * how semantic technologies can be used to cope with the diversity 
 * and heterogeneity of software and services in the OSS domain.
